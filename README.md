# Well, Hello There!

I am a software engineer with a focus on backend, resiliance and observability.

Some of the technologies I work with are Go, Ruby, Kubernetes, OpenTelemetry. I
am also a (too infrequent) contributor to Open-Source, and have contributed to
various projects such as [Ruby on Rails](https://github.com/rails/rails/commits?author=dmathieu) and [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/commits?author=dmathieu).

I am writing about [software engineering](https://dmathieu.com), and [brewing beer (fr)](https://brewfun.net).

I work at [Heroku](https://heroku.com), where I am focused on improving observability.
